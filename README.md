# Mobility_RIS
* It resulted in an accepted paper to ICC 2023 conference
# List of main files #
* **SmartInitRun**: It generates Fig. 2 where it loads a specific data including the large scale parameters of the channel.
* **RandomWalkRun**: It generates and extract the large scale parameters of the channel. 
* **PlotTrajectory**: It results in Fig. 1. and in addition it has two configuration to demonstrate the user random walk in the room.
* **MobilityMLTracking**: It generates Fig. 3. One can configure how often the channel should be re-estimated and RIS be reconfigured.
